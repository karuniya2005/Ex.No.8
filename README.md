## Aim  
To generate a stylized digital anime version of a given classic realism portrait using AI, while preserving the character’s original expression and pose.

## Procedure  
1. Select a portrait image in **classic realism style** as the input.  
2. Write a prompt describing how the portrait should be transformed into an anime style.  
3. Ensure the prompt specifies:  
   - Anime style (digital anime, cel-shaded, vibrant, etc.).  
   - Retain character’s **expression and pose**.  
   - Details like smooth line art, stylized coloring, or background preferences.  
4. Example prompt:  
   > *“Convert this classic realism portrait into a vibrant anime-style digital artwork. Keep the character’s original facial expression and pose intact, while applying anime-style shading, big expressive eyes, and stylized hair highlights.”*  
5. Input the portrait and crafted prompt into the AI image-generation tool.  
6. Generate and review the output.  
7. Refine the prompt if needed to adjust colors, proportions, or artistic effects.

## Instructions  
- Use **style-specific keywords** (anime, manga, cel-shaded, vibrant colors).  
- Mention what should **not change** (pose, expression, overall likeness).  
- Use iterative prompting for better results.  
- If required, add artist inspiration styles (e.g., *“inspired by Makoto Shinkai”* or *“Studio Ghibli-style”*).
